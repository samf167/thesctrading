    "text": "Our team is implementing a buy low / sell high strategy focused on short-term momentum trading in TSLA stock. We aim to take advantage of periods of elevated volatility and momentum, holding positions for 10 trading days or less. We use the 10 day window to account for the fact that some of our data sources are weekly and may provide more signal over a longer trade horizon. Of course, if the system hits its limit point during the window, the position will close similar to our HW1 model.\n*note that we plan to use backward elimination ML method to determine most important features. We plan to trial a variety of alternative data features from FRED (detailed at the end of the website) as well as some competitor company technical factors.\n\n\nPre-Trade Filter\n\nCheck if job postings for software roles increased week-over-week (as well as other FRED/alternative data including pairs performance)\nCheck if implied volatility (IV) percentile &gt; 40% and &lt; 90%\nIf both are true → proceed to trade evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use four exit triggers to manage risk and lock in profits:\n\nIf position is open for more than 5 trading days (one week), exit regardless of performance\nIf IV percentile drops below 30%, exit\nExit if price reaches a profit target of 2x last week’s average true range (ATR)\nUse a trailing stop loss of 1.5x ATR below the highest price reached since entry\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition size will adapt based on strength of indicators and perhaps on a regression of additional features not used to determine the weekly position strategy similar to the logistic regression model used in HW1.
