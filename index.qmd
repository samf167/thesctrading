## S&C Trading Strategy Overview

### 1. Strategy Outline

Our team is implementing a buy low / sell high strategy focused on short-term momentum trading in TSLA stock. We aim to take advantage of periods of elevated volatility and momentum, holding positions for 10 trading days or less. We use the 10 day window to account for the fact that some of our data sources are weekly and may provide more signal over a longer trade horizon. Of course, if the system hits its limit point during the window, the position will close similar to our HW1 model.

#### Example Trade Walkthrough

Pre-Trade Filter:
1. Check if job postings for software roles increased week-over-week (as well as other FRED/alternative data including pairs performance)
2. Check if implied volatility (IV) percentile > 50% and < 90%
3. If both are true â†’ proceed to trade evaluation


*note that we plan to use backward elimination ML method to determine most important features. We plan to trial a variety of alternative data features from FRED (detailed at the end of the website) as well as some competitor company technical factors. **We also wish to include valuation metrics using the yfinance package.***

Buy Conditions:
1. Price is above the 50-day SMA (or EMA) *note we may also include valuation metrics here to avoid extreme overvaluation given our long-only strategy*
2. Gamma exposure is positive (or some other greek we can calculate)

### 2. Exit Strategy

We use four exit triggers to manage risk and lock in profits:

1. If position is open for more than 10 trading days, exit regardless of performance
2. If IV percentile drops below 30%, exit
3. Exit if price reaches a profit target of 2x last week's average true range (ATR)
4. Use a trailing stop loss of 1.5x ATR below the highest price reached since entry

### 3. Position Sizing Framework

Position size will adapt based on strength of indicators and perhaps on a regression of additional features not used to determine the weekly position strategy similar to the logistic regression model used in HW1. We envision a less binary model where sizing is continuous determined on a variety of features (allows us to take risk off but also keep risk on more granularly than the original model).

Conditions for each tier will be finalized after further backtesting.

### 4. Data Requirements

We plan to collect and process:

- Price data and technical indicators (SMA, ATR, IV, Options contracts)
- Job posting data & other relevant metrics from FRED
- Automotive industry data from FRED
- Implied volatility percentile data (via IBKR)

We may use the FRED API, yFinance, or custom scrapers to automate data gathering.

### 5. Next Steps

- Gather full feature list and find good alt data and implement backward elimination model to decide useful features
- Build & backtest position sizing model
- Backtest the strategy on historical TSLA data
- Deploy the final version to https://thesctrading.com

### 6. Practice Data Table

```{python}
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
table = [["Sun","696,000",1.989e30],
         ["Earth","6,371",5.972e24],
         ["Moon","1,737",7.34e22],
         ["Mars","3,390",6.39e23]]
Markdown(tabulate(
  table,
  headers=["Astronomical object","R (km)", "mass (kg)"]
))
```

### 8. FRED Data: Software Developer Job Postings

The below is demonstrating our ability to use the FRED API to pull in features. This example is weekly software job postings. We plan to scour FRED to identify other features that may be useful. Other things may include potential regulatory items or things indicating sentiment on Elon as well as other automotive industry stats including production, CPI, etc. We plan to test a variety and perhaps identify the most powerful features through supervised feature selection methods. Likely **backward selection** where the model evaluates all the features and removes the least powerful/most noisy one by one.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from fredapi import Fred

# Connect to FRED
fred = Fred(api_key="1c00931ee7dc4304c6bb68b72fb2d68f")

# Fetch data
series_id = "IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE"
data = fred.get_series(series_id)

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["Job Postings"])
df.index.name = "Date"
df = df.reset_index()

# Display last 5 rows as table
df.tail()
```

```{python}
# Plot the time series
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.plot(df["Date"], df["Job Postings"], linewidth=2)
plt.title("US Software Developer Job Postings Index")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Index Value")
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
